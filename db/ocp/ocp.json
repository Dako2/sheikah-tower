Our SDN system also starts to provide a new service model called predictable endpoint-network synergy traffic steering. We define our traffic control behaviors as different services  with explicit metrics. Business apps running on hosts can subscribe to these services by getting service SIDs. With SRv6's extended header programming ability, hosts at any granularity can get their customized service powered by optimization algorithms running in our control system with accurate traffic behavior result estimation, thus called predictable. This new service model will become our standard solution for new application scenarios.",

Additionally, there are size limitations, with less space between rows of equipment than what is found in typical data centers, requiring smaller enclosures with limited access to the rear of the rack. With these base specifications, Nokia aims to ensure   compatibility of future solutions with current systems, as telecom equipment are typically in service for long cycles.",

Instead of attempting to create benchmarks using real services / mocked up services, we took a completely different approach to measuring microservice “performance” on our hardware. We created a service agnostic performance abstraction, by profiling hundreds of hosts in our fleet using Intels top-down telemetry package. Analyzing this data provided us a clear top-down pattern of which resources within the core pipeline and memory subsystem were heavily used when running our microservices in production. From this data, we then selected a few SPECCPU2017 subcomponent(s) whose top-down profile(s) closely matched the “top down profile” seen in our production fleet.

      "event_details": "We describe our experience developing what we believe to be the world’s first large-scale production deployments of lightwave fabrics for datacenter networking and machine learning (ML) applications. Using optical circuit switches (OCSes) and optical transceivers developed in-house, we employ hardware and software codesign to integrate the fabrics into our network and computing infrastructure. Key to our design is a high degree of multiplexing enabled by new kinds of wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) and optical circulators that support high-bandwidth bidirectional traffic on a single strand of optical fiber. The development of the requisite OCS and optical transceiver technologies leads to a synchronous lightwave fabric that is reconfigurable, low latency, rate agnostic, and highly available. These fabrics have provided substantial benefits for long-lived traffic patterns in our datacenter networks and predictable traffic patterns in tightly-coupled compute clusters. We report results for a large-scale ML superpod with 4096 tensor processing unit (TPU) chips that has more than one ExaFLOP of computing power. For this use case, the deployment of a lightwave fabric provides up to 3× better system availability and model-dependent performance improvements of up to 3.3× compared to a static fabric, despite constituting less than 6% of the total system cost.",

Our results will demonstrate that a carbon-driven methodology taking into account system-level, rack-level, and data-center-level quantification of detailed carbon footprints, can optimize for scalability, performance, and operational efficiency without compromise.

However, component tolerances and real-world operating conditions can result in the loss of soft-switching of active devices and soft-charging of capacitors, adding challenges to industry adoption of these converters. This work therefore presents a family of autotuning control techniques that can ensure soft-switching and soft-charging operation even with variable component values and changing operating conditions.  ",

With operating currents beyond 1000 A, the high power distribution network (PDN) resistance of the current lateral power delivery (LPD) solution can lead to a dramatic voltage drop and unacceptable power distribution losses, which significantly limits processor performance, reduces system energy efficiency, and hinders data center decarbonization. This work presents a high-performance 48-V-to-1-V switching bus converter to address the above challenges with vertical power delivery (VPD). With the sufficiently high power density enabled by the switching-bus-based architecture, the proposed switching bus converter can be placed underneath the microprocessors, which can significantly reduce the PDN resistance. A hardware prototype was designed, built, and tested up to 1200-A output current and achieved excellent performance.",

The connectors are constructed from metallic optical benches that hold arrays of single-mode optical fibers, and they couple light to/from QPICs via reflective, freeform mirrors. They are compatible with multiple PIC platforms, including silicon-on-insulator and silicon nitride.  Because they are metallic, they can be used over a large temperature ranges including operation at cryogenic temperatures.  This paper considers the opto-mechanical design of the connectors for vertical coupling using diffractive grating couplers. Low losses are obtained despite misalignment using expanded-beam optical paths.

Emerging CXL devices can help expand bandwidth and capacity in these environments leading to improved performance. In this work, we evaluate the performance of CXL memory bandwidth and capacity expansion at the caching layer of these services. To enable CXL, we extend CacheLib, a general-purpose caching library from Meta, to support multiple byte-addressable memory tiers. In our design, the first tier is DRAM-backed memory, the second tier is CXL-backed memory, and the last level remains backed by NVM device. Compared to a system without CXL – we improve the throughput by reducing pressure on NVM layer and increase total cache hit ratio with additional CXL memory. Furthermore, our multi-tier CacheLib outperforms OS interleaving of DRAM/CXL memory in terms of throughput and reduces P99 latency.",

      "event_details": "The introduction of CXL has significantly advanced the enablement of memory disaggregation. Along with disaggregation has risen the need for reliable and effective ways to transparently tier data in real time between local direct attached CPU memory and CXL pooled memory. While the CXL hardware level elements have advanced in definition, the OS level support, drivers and application APIs that facilitate mass adoption are still very much under development and still in discovery phase. Even though memory tiering presents new challenges, we can learn a great deal from the evolution of storage from direct attached to storage area networks, software defined storage and early disaggregated/composable storage solutions such as NVMe over fabrics.

      "event_details": "The use of cryptography in today’s networks is pervasive, much beyond the common use of TLS for E2E security, and including all aspects related to infrastructure management and network support systems. In this context, the threat associated to the vulnerability of current crypto algorithms to quantum computing becomes much more than a theoretical risk. The network industry needs solutions able to support quantum-safe crypto mechanisms and needs them to satisfy two main requirements: agility, as the possibility to maintain alternate evolution paths as algorithms and technologies evolve, and malleability, as the capacity of being adapted to network management best practices.This talk intends to analyze the current landscape of quantum-safe crypto, focusing on those solutions based on quantum technologies and how they can satisfy the two essential requirements mentioned above. Further on, we will analyze how these technologies can be applied to enhance network security, and the steps the industry is taking to evaluate and make the technology evolve to support quantum-safe networking, exemplified by the recently launched European initiative on quantum cryptography, the QSNP (https://qsnp.eu).",

This requires intelligence at every level of the disaggregated memory fabric and relies on techniques like prefetching, caching, and near memory/storage compute to mitigate the high latency to far memory.  The fabric memory controller (ie. FPGA/ASIC) evaluates the needs of the requesting agent, derives the cluster level telemetry, make decisions on the data movement, data placement, replication, compression etc across the entire far memory hierarchy. This is complementary to the OS based techniques focused on movement between near and far memory hierarchies. The ability to extend the far memory tiers to remote nodes can help achieve the benefits of both memory tiering and pooling ie. provide additional capacity and bandwidth, while creating multiple pooled resources available to more than one node.",

We propose a simplified source routing framework enabled by SAI that predetermines flow paths, and programs them across access nodes in an AI fabric, taking advantage of AI training flow predictability.In the proposed framework, software controllers engineer traffic flows between training elements, optimizing for bandwidth utilization, load, and latency.

PTM and synchronization in GPS-denied wireless sensor networks are challenging due to unknown time delays in the network stack and imprecise propagation delay measurements due to limited bandwidth.Instead, we measure time and frequency skew between a transmitter and receiver by leveraging wireless phase information and compensate for inaccuracies. Specifically, carrier frequency offsets and sampling time offsets appear as phase changes over multiple packets and frequencies and serve as feedback to discipline the onboard oscillators. This talk will 1. precisely model these phase offsets, 2. connect them to the underlying time and frequency offset between the transmitter and receiver, 3. present closed-loop control algorithms to reduce clock drift, and 4. compensate for the effects of multiple wireless signal reflections on the measured phase.  ",

They allow administrators to remotely monitor and manage thousands of servers within cloud data centers. By necessity, BMCs have access to critical server functions, such as installing operating systems and monitoring and controlling cooling fans, power supplies, and operating temperatures. Compromising a BMC, therefore, can lead to a compromised server. Vulnerabilities can remain undetected and uncorrected for years, as was discovered in the “Pantsdown” exposure in 2019. Remote access to BMCs makes them attractive targets to orchestrate attacks at scale. Correspondingly, cloud data centers operate at scale. Therefore, securing the BMC on cloud servers is important to prevent unauthorized access, maintain system integrity and availability, protect against attacks, meet compliance requirements, and enable effective remote server management. The Open Compute Project (OCP) Security Workgroup has identified security of the BMC as a key focus area. This work specifically targets three of OCP’s core tenets:  Impact, Openness, and Scalability and suggests guidelines for securing these vital system components.",

To help datacenter chipmakers add an RoT to devices, OCP started the open-source project Caliptra, which defines core RoT capabilities that must be implemented in any device in a cloud platform. The core of Caliptra’s attestation mechanism is based on a Unique Device Secret. This talk explains how SRAM based Physical Unclonable Functions (or PUFs) provide these root secrets in the most secure and flexible way. PUFs extract unique silicon properties or “silicon fingerprints” from chips to validate authenticity of each individual chip and to extract cryptographic keys. PUFs increase system security since the keys they create are never stored in non-volatile memory. Furthermore, they add flexibility because PUFs don’t require key provisioning or on-chip non-volatile memory. ",
